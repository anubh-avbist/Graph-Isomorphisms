			<b>Instructions:</b> Press e to change edit mode, and c to change which graph (G or H) that you're editing. 
			If you're in "Adding Nodes" mode, click around the graph to add nodes. If you're in "Adding Edges" mode,
			click on one node and another node of the same graph to create an edge between them. All graphs are simple, meaning that 
			you cannot make edges from a node to itself, and each pair of ndoes has at most one edge. The rest 
			of the important info should be listed below:
